### Why Tardis?

If you saw Doctor who series, you might be familiar with this name.  
Anyway this is just a fun project to build myself and anyone else who desire to have a play ground to test new things.

### Why Backup?

For no reason :smile: 
The idea for playing with compression and encryption algorithms and get to know a little bit Git internals have brought
me here.

### How to build?

Since the project doesn't have any build script yet, a few things need to be installed manually like vcpkg and necessary
packages.

* vcpkg
    * flatbuffers
    * spdlog
    * zstd
